DESCRIPTION
-----------

	BibORB provides a web-based frontend to BibTeX. It was first designed to 
provide a web-interface to browse and share bibliographies using the BibTeX 
format and easily archive electronic releases of articles (upload copies of 
papers into BibORB so that they are available for anyone consulting the 
database). Now, it also includes a basic web-based BibTeX editor, search 
functions and a basic user management system to set permissions (add / modify /
delete) to recorded bibliographies.

	BibORB can be installed:
        - for a personal use (on a local machine running a webserver): edit your
bibliography (using BibORB or your favorite text editor) and easily browe it by
using your web browser.

        - on a network to share bibliographic references. You will have then the
choice to allow other people to add, delete or update the references or only 
install BibORB to allow references viewing and searching.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
	BibORB is based on PHP, XML, XSL and use web pages formated using XHTML/CSS
standards. Consequently, you should ensure that:

	* PHP (>=4.0.3) is installed on your webserver.
	* PHP XSLT functions are available.
    * PHP Pear functions are available.
	* MySQL or any other database if you wish to use authentication.


BIBLIOGRAPHIES
--------------

    The "bibs" directory contains all bibliographies created by BibORB as well
as the electronic releases of papers that would have been uploaded.

    Under the hypothesis that the bibliography named "test" exists, "bibs" is
structured as follows:

    bibs/
     |->test/
         |->test.bib
         |->test.xml
         |->description.txt
         |->papers/
             |->...lots of pdf, ps, ps.gz :) ...
     |->otherdatabases.....

    References are stored in the test.xml but a BibTeX copy is maintained 
up-to-date for convenience. It is also possible to modify directly the test.bib
file to modify your bibliography and then use "Update from BibTeX" in the Admin
BibORB menu to update the BibORB bibliography. (it may be usefull for users that
edit their BibTeX file with other tools).

BIBTEX - XML
------------

Some bibtex fields were added :
    * ABSTRACT: 	abstract of the paper
	* GROUPS:       for classification purpose, separate each group by comma
    * KEYWORDS: 	paper's keywords
	* URL:          link to the ps version of the paper for instance
	* URLZIP:       link to the ps.gz version of the paper
	* PDF:          link to the pdf version of the paper
	* WEBSITE:      url of author website, or tool or....
    * LINK:         url of a local page
    * LONGNOTES:    misc information, remarks...

If you edit your BibTeX independently of the tool, only the filename
is needed in url, urlzip and pdf. You will have to put manually the
e-papers into the appropriate papers directory.

Warning!! the script used to load BibTeX data into BibORB does not transform 
LaTeX code. If @string macros are present in bibtex data, they are expanded 
before adding the data to BibORB. It also does not transform authors name
and lastname.
