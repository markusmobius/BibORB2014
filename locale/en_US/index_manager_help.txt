The manager allows to create or delete bibliographies.

<table class='help'>
  <tbody>
    <tr class='colored'>
      <th>Add a bibliography</th>
      <td>Necessary files will be created to store
	the bibliography. An existing BibTeX bibliography may be then
	imported using the import menu.</td>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Delete a bibliography</th>
      <td style='text-align:justify'>The selected bibliography will be
      moved in the <code>bibs/.trash</code> directory. The
      bibliography will be removed from the list of available
      bibliographies. In order to definitively remove it,
      the <code>bibs/.trash</code> has to be cleaned manually.
