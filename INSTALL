This is a text copy of the documentation provided in the directory
doc/ that comes with the BibORB distribution.

--------


Requirements
------------

BibORB is based on PHP, XML, XSL and use web pages formated using XHTML/CSS 
standards. Consequently, you should ensure that:

    * PHP (>=4.0.3) is installed on your webserver.
    * PHP XSLT functions are available.
    * PHP Pear functions are available.

Authentication is done using databases (MySQL) or text files.

PHP XSLT
--------

It appears that XSLT support is not always enabled in some PHP distributions. 
You will have to check that PHP is compiled with the option --with-sablot or
--with-xslt-sablot. http://www.php.net/xslt is a good starting point to get 
information on the install process.

Once XSLT support is enabled, you'll have to activate XSLT module in the 
configuration of PHP (php.ini):

    * on *nix add (or uncomment) the line:
        extension=xslt.so

    * on Windows add (or uncomment) the line:  
        extension=php_xslt.so

PHP Pear
--------

PHP Pear package may be available on your OS distribution. Otherwise 
http://pear.php.net provides instructions to install it on your system.

Upgrade from BibORB 1.3.2
--------------------------

   1. Rename your old BibORB directory
        mv biborb biborb.old

   2. Untar the archive: tar -xvzf biborb-x.tar.gz
   3. Copy or move the biborb.old/bibs directory to the new biborb directory.
   4. If you were using files authentication, copy bib_access.txt and
      bib_users.txt (located in the directory php/auth_backends) to data/auth_files. 

Install
-------

   1. Untar the archive: tar -xvzf biborb-x.tar.gz to your webserver's document
    root (/var/www for instance) or your personal web directory ( ~/public_html for instance)
   2. Make the bibs directory writable by the webserver. You can:
          * change its group to the webserver's group and give this group write 
          access to bibs:
                
                chgrp www-data bibs
                chmod g+w bibs

          * allow anyone to have a write access (not recommended for security reasons):

                chmod a+w bibs

   3. By default, authentication is not activated. Edit the config.php file and 
   customize BibORB to feet your needs. (See Configuration Help)
